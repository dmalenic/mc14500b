# Roll a Die

`k14500b_roll_a_die` simulates rolling a 6-sided die. When the program starts, the die rolls.
Pressing the input `IN1` switch stops the roll and shows the current number. Releasing it, the die rolls again.
This program provides a sample of how a lookup table can extend the range of the `JMP` instruction to the complete program
space. It is still limited to 16 different target addresses only, but it is not confined to the first 16 locations.
